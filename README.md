# Random-Password-Generator

# The purupose of this program is to give a random password based off of user input. We ask the requirements of the
password that the user would like (length,if they want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special chars). Then 
the program prints out a copy and pasteable password that they can use for any website they please. This will help with secure
passwords and keep the user's information private.
